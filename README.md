spec5-reserved-names
====================

A list of domain names which must be reserved by gTLD Registry Operators.

Specification 5 ("Schedule of Reserved Names") of the ICANN Registry Agreement for generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) specifies several sets of names which must be reserved by the Registry Operator at the second level in their TLD.

The Registry Agreement does not enumerate all of these names; and ICANN has not published an authoritative list.

To mitigate the risk of confusion caused by different Registry Operators each assembling their own list, and to reduce the duplication of work which might arise, this project exists to aggregate and collate data from each of the sources referenced in Specification 5 in a format which can be easily imported into a Registry Operator's SRS database.
